#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/6IT6MORS-UA>
#### Description: 
For my final project, I created a personal portfolio website. One of the things I struggled the most with in this class was writting html and CSS. 
So, for my final project, I wanted to spend time learning more about what you can do with html and css. 

This portfolio website contains 4 sections; About, Experience, Project and Contact. This minimalistic portfolio website is perfect for showing quick information about myself, my current computer science projects, and how to contact me. Clicking the nav text at the top of the screen will scroll you down to each one of the sections. The entire website is written on one html file, index.html. The about section contains a picutre of myself, a button to open my CV, a button to go to the contact section, a button to go to my linked in, and a button to go to my github. The next section is a basic about me section contain a picture of my family and some quick facts about myself. The third section shows some of my computer science experience. The forth section shows 2 of my current projects and the final section contains information to contact me. 

In this project, I learned much more about html and css. I learned about the difference between "class" and "id", when to use certain html tags, how to utilize css to not repeat code, and much more styling option. One thing I struggled with was understanding the layout and display. It can be a little tricky understanding how div are placed inside of eachother and how that effect the layout and specific formatting. These two things are something I want to focus on going forward but this project allowed me to build a solid foundation so that I know what is possible.
