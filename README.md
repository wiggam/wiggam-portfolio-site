#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/6IT6MORS-UA>
#### Description: 
For my final project, I created a personal portfolio website. One of the things I struggled the most with in this class was writting html and CSS. 
So, for my final project, I wanted to spend time learning more about what you can do with html and css. 

This portfolio website contains 4 sections; About, Experience, Project and Contact. Clicking the nav text at the top of the screen will scroll you down to each one of the sections
The entire website is written on one html file, index.html. The about section contains a picutre of myself, a button to open my CV, a button to go to the contact section, a button to go to my linked in, and a button to go to my github. The next section is a basic about me section contain a picture of my family and some quick facts about myself. The third section shows some of my computer science experience. The forth section shows 2 of my current projects and the final section contains information to contact me.
